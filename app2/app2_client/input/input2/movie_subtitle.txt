Forget it. Its too risky.
Im through doing that shit.
You always say that.
The same thing every time.
lm through, never again,
too dangerous.
I know thats what I always say.
Im always right too.
- You forget about it in a day or two.
- The days of me forgetting are over.
The days of me remembering
have just begun.
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?
- I sound like a sensible fuckin man.
- You sound like a duck.
- Quack, quack, quack.
- Take heart, cause youre never
gonna have to hear it again.
Since Im never gonna
do it again, youre never
gonna have to hear me quack.
- After tonight?
- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
- Can I get anyone more coffee?
- Oh, yes!
- Thank you.
- Youre welcome.
I mean, the way it is now,
youre takin the same risk
as when you rob a bank.
Takin more of a risk.
Banks are easier.
Federal banks aint supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.
Theyre insured. Why should
they give a fuck? I dont even
need a gun in a Federal bank.
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,
We got this guys little girl.
If you dont give him all your
money, were gonna kill her.
- Did it work?
- Fuckin right it worked.
Thats what Im talkin about.
Knucklehead walks into a bank
with a telephone. Not a pistol,
not a shotgun, a fuckin phone.
- Cleans the place out.
They dont lift a fuckin finger.
- Did they hurt the little girl?
There probably never was
a little girl. The point of
the story isnt a little girl.
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.
- You want to rob banks?
- Im not saying I wanna rob banks.
Im illustrating if we did, itd be
easier than what weve been doing.
-No more liquor stores?
-Whatve we been talkin about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.
Besides, it aint the giggle
it used to be. Theres too many
foreigners own liquor stores.
Vietnamese, Koreans,
dont even speak fuckin English.
You tell em empty out
the register, they dont know
what youre talkin about.
They make it too personal.
- We keep on, one of these gook
fuckers gonna make us kill him.
- Im not gonna kill anybody.
I dont want to either.
But theyll probably put us
in a situation where its us or them.
And if its not the gooks,
its these old fuckin Jews whove owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.
You got Grandpa lrving sitting
behind the counter with
a fucking Magnum in his hand.
Try walkin into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.
See how far that gets you.
Forget it.
- Were out of it.
- Well, what then, day jobs?
- Not in this life.
- What then?
Garçon, coffee!
This place.
Garçon means boy.
This place?
A coffee shop?
Whats wrong with that?
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?
Bars, liquor stores,
gas stations; you get your head
blown off stickin up one of them.
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.
Theyre not expectin to get robbed.
Not as expectin anyway.
- I bet you could cut down on the
hero factor in a place like this.
- Correct.
Same as banks,
these places are insured.
Manager.
He dont give a fuck.
Theyre just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin the diners.
Waitresses. Fuckin forget it.
No way theyre takin a bullet
for the register.
Busboys. Some wetback gettin
paid $1.50 an hour...
really give a fuck
youre stealin from the owner?
Customers sittin there
with food in their mouths,
they dont know whats goin on.
One minute, theyre havin
a Denver omelet, the next, someone
is stickin a gun in their face.
See, I got the idea the last
liquor store we stuck up, remember?
- All the customers kept comin in.
- Yeah.
You got the idea
of takin their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.
- Thank you.
- Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.
- Yes, we did.
- A lot of people come to restaurants.
- A lot of wallets.
- Pretty smart, huh?
Pretty smart.
Im ready. Lets do it.
Right now, right here.
- Come on.
- All right. Same as
last time, remember?
Youre crowd control.
Ill handle the employees.
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.
Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!
Any of you fucking pricks move,
and Ill execute
every motherfuckin last one of you.
and Ill execute
every motherfuckin last one of you.

- Okay, so tell me again
about the hash bars.
- Okay, what you want to know?
- Hash is legal there, right?
- Its legal, but it aint 100% legal.
You just cant walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint and start puffin away.
I mean, they want you to smoke in
your home or certain designated places.
- Those are hash bars?
- Yeah. It breaks down like this.
Its legal to buy it.
Its legal to own it.
And if youre the proprietor
of a hash bar, its legal to sell it.
Its illegal to carry it,
but-but that doesnt matter,
cause get a load of this.
If you get stopped by a cop
in Amsterdam, its illegal
for them to search you.
- I mean, thats a right the cops
in Amsterdam dont have.
- Oh, man! Im goin.
Thats all there is to it.
Im fuckin goin.
I know, baby.
Youd dig it the most.
- But you know what the funniest thing
about Europe is?
- What?
Its the little differences.
I mean, they got the same shit
over there that they got here,
- but its just there,
its a little different.
- Example.
You can walk into a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.
And I dont mean just like no paper cup.
Im talkin about a glass of beer.
And in Paris, you can buy
a beer in McDonalds.
You know what they call...
a Quarter-Pounder
with Cheese in Paris?
They dont call it
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?
They got the metric system.
They wouldnt know what the fuck
a Quarter-Pounder is.
- What do they call it?
- They call it a Royale with Cheese.
- Royale with Cheese.
- Thats right.
What do they call a Big Mac?
Big Macs a Big Mac,
but they call it Le Big Mac.
[ Imitating French Accent ]
Le Big Mac. [ Laughs ]
- What do they call a Whopper?
- I dont know. I didnt
go into Burger King.
- You know what they put on French fries
in Holland instead of ketchup?
- What?
- Mayonnaise. [ Chuckles ]
- Goddamn!
- I seen em do it, man.
They fuckin drown em in that shit.
- Yuck.
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.
- How many up there?
- Three or four.
- Thats countin our guy?
- Not sure.
- So that means that it could be
up to five guys up there?
- Its possible.
We should have
fuckin shotguns.
- Whats her name?
- Mia.
- Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?
- I dont know.
However people meet people.
She used to be a actress.
Oh, really?
She do anything Id have seen?
- I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.
- Pilot? Whats a pilot?
- Well, you know the shows on TV?
- I dont watch TV.
Yeah, but you are aware that there
is an invention called television,
- and on this invention
they show shows, right?
- Yeah.
The way they pick TV shows is they make
one show. That shows called a pilot.
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...
and on the strength of that
one show, they decide if
they wanna make more shows.
Some get chosen and
become television programs.
Some dont, become nothin.
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.
You remember
Antwan Rockamora?
Half-black, half-Samoan.
Used to call him Tony Rocky Horror.
- Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?
- I wouldnt go so far as to
call the brother fat.
I mean, he got a weight problem.
Whats a nigger gonna do? Hes Samoan.
- I think I know who you mean.
What about him?
- Marsellus fucked him up good.
Word round the campfire is
it was on account of
Marsellus Wallaces wife.
[ Elevator Bell Rings ]
- So what hed do? Fuck her?
- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin that bad.
- Well, then what then?
- He gave her a foot massage.
A foot massage?
- Thats it?
- Mm-hmm.
Then whatd Marsellus do?
Sent a couple cats over to his place.
They took him out on his patio.
Threw his ass over the balcony.
Nigger fell four stories.
He had a little garden down
at the bottom enclosed in glass,
like a greenhouse.
Nigger fell through that.
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.
- Thats a damn shame.
- Hmm.
- But still, you play
with matches, you get burned.
- What do you mean?
You dont be givin Marsellus Wallaces
new bride a foot massage.
You dont think he overreacted?
Antwan didnt expect Marsellus
to react the way he did,
but he had to expect a reaction.
It was a foot massage.
A foot massage is nothin.
I give my mother a foot massage.
Its laying your hands in a familiar way
on Marselluss new wife.
I mean, is it as bad as eatin
her pussy out? No, but its
the same fuckin ballpark.
Whoa, stop right there.
Eatin the bitch out...
and givin the bitch a foot massage
aint even the same fucking thing.
- Its not. Its the same ballpark.
- Aint no fuckin ballpark neither.
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine.
But touchin his wifes feet
and sticking your tongue
in the holiest of holies...
aint the same fuckin ballpark;
it aint the same league;
it aint the same fuckin sport.
- Foot massages dont mean shit!
- Have you ever given a foot massage?
[ Scoffs ]
Dont be tellin me about foot massages.
- Im the foot fuckin master.
- You given a lot of them?
Shit, yeah!
Got my technique down and everything.
I dont be ticklin or nothin.
Would you give a guy
a foot massage?
- Fuck you.
- [ Chuckles ]
- You give em a lot?
- Fuck you.
- You know, Im kind of tired.
I could use a foot massage.
- Yo, yo, yo, man.
You best back off.
Im gettin a little pissed here.
- This is the door.
- Yeah, it is.
What time you got?
7:22 in the a.m.
No, it aint quite time yet.
Come on. Lets hang back.
Look, just cause I wouldnt give no man
a foot massage dont make it right...
for Marsellus to throw
Antwan off a building into
a glass motherfuckin house,
fuckin up the way the nigger talks;
that shit aint right.
Motherfucker do that shit to me,
he better paralyze my ass,
cause I kill the motherfucker.
I aint sayin its right,
but you sayin a massage dont mean
nothin. Im sayin it does.
Now, look, Ive given a million
ladies a million foot massages,
and they all meant somethin.
We act like they dont,
but they do. Thats whats
so fuckin cool about them.
Theres a sensuous thing goin on...
where you dont talk about it,
but you know it and she knows it.
Fuckin Marsellus knew it. And Antwan
shouldve fuckin better known better.
Thats his fuckin wife, man.
This aint a man with a sense
of humor about this shit.
You know what Im sayin?
Its an interestin point.
Come on.
Lets get into character.
- Whats her name again?
- Mia.
- Mia.
- Why you so interested
in big mans wife?
Hes goin out of town, Florida.
And he asked me if Id take care
of her while hes gone.
- Take care of her?
- No, man. Just take her out.
Show her a good time.
Make sure she dont get lonely.
Youre gonna be takin
Mia Wallace out on a date?
It is not a date.
Its just like if you were
gonna take your buddys wife
to a movie or somethin.
- Its just good company, thats all.
- [ Sighs ]
- Its not a date.
Its definitely not a date.
- [ Sighs ]
Hey, kids.
How you boys doin?
Hey, keep chillin.
You know who we are?
Were associates of your
business partner, Marsellus Wallace.
You do remember
your business partner, dont you?
Now, let me take
a wild guess here.
- Youre Brett, right?
- Yeah.
I thought so. You remember
your business partner Marsellus Wallace,
dont ya, Brett?
Yeah, I remember.
Good. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.
Sorry about that.
Whatcha havin?
Hamburgers.
Hamburgers! The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.
What kind of hamburgers?

Big Kahuna Burger!

Mmmm.

Vincent!
You ever had
a Big Kahuna burger?
Want a bite?
Theyre real tasty.
- I aint hungry.
- Well, if you like burgers,

Me, I cant usually get em
cause my girlfriends a vegetarian,
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian.
But I do love the taste
of a good burger. Mmmm.
You know what they call
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese
in France?
- No.
- Tell em, Vincent.
- A Royale with Cheese.
- A Royale with Cheese.
You know why they call it that?
Uh, because of
the metric system?
Check out the big brain
on Brett!
Youre a smart motherfucker.
Thats right. The metric system.
- Whats in this?
- Sprite.
Sprite. Good.
You mind if I have some of your
tasty beverage to wash this down with?
Go right ahead.
[ Slurping, Sighs ]
That hit the spot.
You. Flock of Seagulls.
You know why were here?
- Why dont you tell my man
Vince here where you got the shit hid.
- Its over--
I dont remember askin you

B-But I never got yours.

I just want you

I just want you to know how sorry we are
th-that things got so fucked up...
with us and Mr. Wallace.
W-We got into this thing with
the best intentions. Really. I never--
Oh, Im sorry,
did I break your concentration?
- [ Gasping ]
- I didnt mean to do that. Please.
Continue. You were saying something
about best intentions.
Whats the matter?
Oh, you were finished!
Oh, well, allow me to retort.
What does Marsellus Wallace
look like?
What?
- What country you from?
- What?

- No!
- Then why you tryin
to fuck him like a bitch?
- I didnt.
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett!
- You tried to fuck him.
- [ Gasping ] No, no.
But Marsellus Wallace dont like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.
- You read the Bible, Brett?
- Yes!
Well, theres this passage
I got memorized. Sort of
fits this occasion.
Ezekiel 25:17.
The path of the righteous man...
is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish...
and the tyranny of evil men.
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and goodwill,
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly
his brothers keeper...
and the finder
of lost children.
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance...
and furious anger...
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers!
And you will know
My name is the Lord...
when I lay My vengeance
upon thee!
[ Screams ]
[ Lets Stay Together ]
[ Man ]
I think you gonna find...
when all this shit
is over and done--
I think youre gonna find yourself
one smilin motherfucker.
The thing is, Butch,
right now...
you got ability.
But painful as it may be,
ability... dont last.
And your days are just about over.
Now, thats a hard
motherfuckin fact of life.
But thats a fact of life your ass
is gonna have to get realistic about.
You see, this business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.
Motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.
If you mean it turns
to vinegar... it does.
If you mean it gets better
with age... it dont.
Besides, Butch,
how many fights you think
you got in you anyway?
Hmm?
Two?
Boxers dont have
an old-timers day.
You came close,
but you never made it.
And if you were gonna make it,
you would have made it before now.
[ Music Continues ]
You my nigger?
Certainly appears so.
[ Chuckles ]
The night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting.
Thats pride fuckin with you.
Fuck pride!
Pride only hurts.
It never helps.
You fight through that shit.
Cause a year from now,
when you kickin it in the Caribbean,
you gonna say to yourself,
Marsellus Wallace was right.
[ Chuckles ]
I got no problem
with that, Mr. Wallace.
In the fifth,
your ass goes down.
Say it.
In the fifth,
my ass goes down.
Yo, Vincent Vega.

- You dont even want to know.
Wheres the big man?
The big mans right over there

Why dont you hang back a second or two.
You see the white boy leave, go on over.
[ Vincent ]

- I been doin pretty good.
How bout yourself?

At Marselluss request.

Look, Im not a fuckin idiot,

Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.
And some matches.
Thanks.
[ Woman ] Its as if it turns every part
of your body into the tip of a penis.
- Whoa.
- Ill lend it to you.
Its a great book on piercing.
That gun to pierce your ears,
they dont use that to pierce
your nipples, do they?
Forget that gun. That guns goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.
All my piercing, 18 places on my body,
every one of em done with a needle.
Five in each ear, one through
the nipple of my left breast,
two in my right nostril,
one in my left eyebrow,
one in my belly,
one in my lip, one in my clit,
- and I wear a stud in my tongue.
- [ Vincent ] Excuse me.
I was just curious,
but, um... why would you wear
a stud in your tongue?
Sex thing.
Helps fellatio.
Vincenzo.
Step in my office.
This is Panda from Mexico.
Very good stuff.
Now, thats Bava.
Different, but equally good.
And that is Choco
from the Harz Mountains of Germany.
Now, the first two are the same.
300 a gram. Those are friend prices.
But this one
is a little more expensive.
This is 500 a gram.
But, when you shoot it, you will know
where that extra money went.
Theres nothing wrong with these two.
This is real, real, real good shit.
But this one
is a fuckin madman.
Remember, I just got back
from Amsterdam.
Am I a nigger?
Are we in lnglewood? No.
Youre in my home. Now, white people
who know the difference...
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.
Now, my shit, Ill take the Pepsi
Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...
- any old day of the fuckin week.
- Thats a bold statement.
This aint Amsterdam, Vince.
This is a sellers market.
Coke is fuckin dead
as... dead.
Heroin, its comin back
in a big fuckin way.
- All right.
Gimme three grams of madman.
- Okay.
Now, if its as good as you say it is,
Ill come back and buy another thousand.
I just hope that I still

but Im givin you some
out of my own private stash.
That is what a nice guy I am.
- Im outta balloons.
Is a baggie all right?
- Yeah, thats cool.
All right.
Ill just get one for ya.
Honey, will you get me some baggies
and, uh, twistix from the kitchen?
[ Woman ]
Okay.
Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi?
She aint got a boyfriend.
- You wanna hang out and get high?
- Which ones Trudi?
-The one with all the shit in her face?
-No, thats Jody.
Thats my wife.
- [ Chuckles ] Im sorry, man.
- Thank you.
- No, I cant. I gotta be someplace.
- All right, no problemo.
- Ill take a rain check.
- [ Knocking ]
- Oh.
- Thank you, Jody.
Still got your Malibu?
Oh, man, you know what some fucker
did the other day?
- What?
- Fuckin keyed it.
- Oh, man, thats fucked up.
- Tell me about it.
I had it in storage
for three years.
It was out five days, and some
dickless piece of shit fucked with it.
They should be fuckin killed,
man. No trial, no jury,
straight to execution.
I wish I couldve caught him
doin it. Id have given
anything to catch that asshole.
- Itd been worth him doin it
just so I couldve caught him.
- What a fucker!
Whats more chicken-shit
than fuckin with a mans automobile?
- Dont fuck with another mans vehicle.
